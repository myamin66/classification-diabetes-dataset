# Classification on Diabetes Dataset
The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (provided with this assignment) involves predicting the onset of diabetes within 5 years in Pima Indians given medical details.
It is a binary (2-class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 768 observations with 8 input variables and 1 output variable. Missing values are believed to be encoded with zero values. The variable names are as follows:
1.	Number of times pregnant.
2.	Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
3.	Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
4.	Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
5.	2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
6.	Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
7.	Diabetes pedigree function.
8.	Age (years).
9.	Class variable (0 or 1).
Load the dataset, and apply following three algorithms, 
1.	Perceptron 
2.	Adaline
3.	Logistic Regression 
You can use scikit-learn implementation of above classification algorithms. 
Please answer following questions within Colab script, 
•	Which algorithm gives best accuracy?
•	display confusion matrix for all three algorithms 
•	display classification report for each of the three algorithms
•	For each of the variable in the input, please visualize it and comment if that variable is a good predictor based on visualization
